Step 3: Architecting your web site

The title for the home page is "Film Club".
Calendar: The calendar page layout belongs in calendar/index.html.
The title for the calendar page is "Film Club - Calendar".
Join: The join page layout belongs in join/index.html.
The title for the join page is "Film Club - Join".
Text content is provided in the attached project-text-content folder.
"Up Next" section movie links

"The Great Train Robbery": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuto7qWrplc
"The Bicycle Thief": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3jnzXX9mXs
"Nosferatu": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC6jFoYm3xs
"Metropolis": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NzALRJifI
Step 4: Styling your website

Use CSS to style the website according to the provided layouts in the project-layout folder.
Within the project-layout there are three sub-folders: small, medium, and large. Each folder's layouts correspond to one of the following breakpoint ranges:
Breakpoint Ranges

breakpoint range	breakpoint range start	breakpoint range end
small	0 (320px)	544px
medium	545px	768px
large	769px	+ and up
Step 5: Considerations

Use flexbox for grid level layout.
Use media queries to define breakpoints.
Use percentages and other relative units to make elements behave in a fluid manner.
The "name" input field on the newsletter page should have the type text.
The "email" input field on the newsletter page should have the type email.
The "password" input field on the newsletter page should have the type password.
The "confirm password" input field on the newsletter page should have the type password.
A user should be able to select multiple genres.
Use cursor: pointer; on elements that either link or perform some functionality.
Add helpful alternative text to the alt attribute of HTML img images.
